Below are elements that should be fixed/expanded:

- Light should be simulated coming from the Sun and casting on planets. Making the sun a light source with large range should accomplish this.
- More satellites should be added.
- Currently rotation is only supported for the Sun and 8 solar system planets due to limited data that could be found, see [Data Documentation](Data%20Documentation##Rotation).
